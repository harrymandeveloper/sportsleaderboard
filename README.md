# Sports Leaderboard

A sports event leaderboard in the style of television broadcast VTR leaderboards, built in 2020, styled on the London 2012 Olympics.

This was designed for a creative project for Festival Stoke to showcase the leaders in an online 'Creative Olympics' during the 2020 coronavirus pandemic.

This project was created by <a href="www.fullybookedtheatre.com">Fully Booked Theatre</a> an interactive children's dance theatre company.

Animations need to move in a particular order, based on previous Olympic leaderboards for sporting events.

Animation order:

1. Logo of event flip in x (so, turning from face down left to face up right).
2. Transition fade in of outline title bar from left to right. 
3. Colour fade in through title bar left to right. 
4. Fade in of event title left to right, one letter at a time.
5. The word 'Leaderboard' appears immediately underneath title and Olympics logo appears within right hand side of of title bar, simultaneously.

All title bar animations complete, next comes the list of players / teams.

6. Fade in down first blank list item.
7. Fade in down player name and position and fade in country (three letters, e.g. KAZ for Kazakhstan).
9. Fade in left to right player country's flag and expand next blank list item.

Repeat 6 - 9 until leaderboard complete.
